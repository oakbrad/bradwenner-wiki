This meticulously researched book reveals a more complete picture of the social conditions that led to the Holocaust. The creation of stateless zones, the hollowing or destruction of institutions, &amp; the zero-sum worldview that incentivized ordinary people to reach for the state's levers of murder. All part of an extra-legal machine meant to encourage violent experimentation that could be reified back into the state.\nMany of the stories are very difficult to read: the murder of children, the improvisation of cars as mobile gas chambers, the woman who was buried alive &amp; naked in a pit of corpses. Other details are horrifying in their mundanity: the Nazis originally provided extra rations of alcohol to soldiers who participated in mass murder, but ultimately found it unnecessary.\nThere are also many tales of those who resisted or rescued Jews, often not out of ideology or bravery, but out of the simple humanity the state could not stamp out (&quot;No one ever left my house naked or hungry&quot; one woman explains).\nIt is of course terrifying to recognize that many of these conditions exist today. The extraordinary renditions and the state machinery that enables it, the tech capitalists who wish to be freed from the &quot;inefficiencies&quot; of democracy to innovate in stateless zones, the paranoid, zero-sum worldview of MAGA.... &quot;a warning&quot;\nHighlighted\nMostly listened on audiobooks so only a couple of highlights.\n\nThroughout Europe, this is what rescuers said again and again: that they were behaving normally. “We regarded it as the most normal thing to help those who needed help”—thus the verdict of a Polish family who sheltered two Jews for much of the war. They were not describing the normality that they saw around them, of course. They were not acting as others acted, or following the explicit or implicit prescriptions of those in power. Their sense of normality must have come from within, or from something learned and internalized before the war, since there were few or no external sources of the norms they exemplified\n\nWanda J.’s judgment about the decisive importance of a sense of humanity seems like a hopeful conclusion, but it is not. Good and evil can be rendered visible, as in memoirs such as hers, but they are not easy to summon or dismiss. Most of us would like to think that we possess the qualities she named: “moral instinct” and “human goodness.” Perhaps we imagine that we would be rescuers in some future catastrophe. Yet if states were destroyed, local institutions corrupted, and economic incentives directed towards murder, few of us would behave well.",

He aims for 10% reduction\n\nHighlighted\n\nI believe large numbers of people have at least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened.\n\n&quot;When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.&quot;\n\nWhat you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.\n\nThe situation comes first. The characters—always flat and unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate.\n\nA strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me.\n\nDescription begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.\n\nWhen it comes to scene-setting and all sorts of description, a meal is as good as a feast\n\nIn a very real sense, every life is in medias res.\n\nThe most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest.",

Butler\nFinished: <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-08-03</a>\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐\nThoughts: I enjoyed this, but not as much as I was hoping. This novel suffers from a common sci-fi problem, which is that most of the book is a setup for future sequels (that Butler never got around to finishing). The dystopian world of a collapsing America certainly has a prophetic quality, but I guess frustrating for me is Butler's refusal to engage in any kind of worldbuilding. She's no Ursula Le Guin, unfortunately. The politicians &amp; movements that led to this capitalist dystopia are named only at the very beginning and the very end with no real insight or explanation into the broader context of the protagonist's journey. Instead, we get fortune-cookie level philosophy about the Earthseed movement and a lot of talk about the protagonist's hyper-empathy syndrome, neither of which I found particularly interesting to the events of this book as a singular dystopian work.\nHighlighted\n\n“The changes.” I thought for a moment. They were slow changes compared to anything that might happen here, but it took a plague to make some of the people realize that things could change.”\n“So?”\n“Things are changing now, too. Our adults haven’t been wiped out by a plague so they’re still anchored in the past, waiting for the good old days to come back. But things have changed a lot, and they’ll change more. Things are always changing. This is just one of the big jumps instead of the little step-by-step changes that are easier to take. People have changed the climate of the world. Now they’re waiting for the old days to come back.”\n\nIt would be more honest to say that the Pox was caused by our own refusal to deal with obvious problems in those areas. We caused the problems: then we sat and watched as they grew into crises.",

The first story, &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;, was the strongest and most memorable - a cosmic horror take on the unreliable narrator. After that they get less interesting as the book progresses, replacing the &quot;weird&quot; supernatural aspects with more typical themes.\nObviously, the reason to read this is the primordial connection to Lovecraft's later works and for that purpose I did enjoy it. I can't help but agree with this contemporary critic's quote from Wikipedia:\n\n&quot;So much of Mr Chambers's work exasperates, because we feel that he might so easily have made it better.&quot;\n-- Frederic Taber Cooper\n\nOnly the first four stories are worth reading and the rest can be skipped.\nHighlights\n\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.\nStranger: I wear no mask.\nCamilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda) No mask? No mask!",
